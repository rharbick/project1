	Easily my favorite part of the website is the cool rocket ship animation, I find myself clicking home over and over
again just to watch the rocket. I like how the cookie of the month and deal of the day stick with you on each page and 
I'm a big fan of the layout of the entire site.

	a. I really like the user experience to this site, the home page is nice and puts the rest of the pages front and center,
	the navigation bar is really helpful also. Both of our sites also aren't very mobile friendly so I would honestly say our
	sites are pretty equal on user experience.
	
	b. Each page uses their own stylesheet which makes this codebase a little harder to maintain than mine, I use a main stylesheet for
	every page and if a page needs more specific styling they have their own stylesheet with just those specific styles.
3.
	The code structure is great, I find it easily readable and everything is organized well into folders.
4.
	Some tiny issues I've noticed is that the sidebars don't stretch all the way down to the bottom of the page and that the site isn't very mobile friendly.

	Overall I really liked the site, it was very entertaining to look through and looked very nice.
